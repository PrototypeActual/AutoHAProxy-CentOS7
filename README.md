# AutoHAProxy-CentOS7
Bash script to deploy HAProxy 1.8.14 on a fresh CentOS 7 machine with very little setting up. There are messages displayed during the installation of this script to keep you aware of certain things as well as comments in the script to explain what the commands in the script do.

I AM WORKING ON UPDATING THIS TO THE LATEST VERSION OF HAPROXY AND TO INCLUDE DESCRIPTIONS/COMMENTS IN THE SCRIPT
